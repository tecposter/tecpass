```shell
git clone https://github.com/tecposter/tecpass.git
cd tecpass
cargo install --path .
```

If rust is installed by `asdf`, run the following command to recreate shims

```shell
asdf reshim rust
```

## Usage

Initialize a password and login to manager accounts.

```shell
tecpass
```

### Import Firefox accounts

Open page `about:logins`, click the right top button `...`, select the menu item `Export Passwords`, and then select a path to save all the firefox passwords in a csv file.

After getting the csv file path, run the following command to import the firefox accounts
```shell
tecpass --import-firefox ./data/firefox-passwords.csv
```

### Import pass accounts

Goto the `tecpass` project folder to run the script `./script/export-pass.sh` to export `pass` accounts to the file `exported_passes`. `pass` will need passphrase to unlock the OpenPGP secret key.

```shell
./script/export-pass.sh
```

Then run the following command to import the `pass` accounts

```shell
tecpass --import-pass ./data/exported_passes
```
