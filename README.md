# TecPass: Tec Password Manager

`TecPass` protects passwords with [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) and [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), and stores them with [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) in local directory `~/.config/tecpass` by default.

`TecPass` is currently in beta. Some features are still being worked on, such as copy/paste being available only on wayland of linux system.
